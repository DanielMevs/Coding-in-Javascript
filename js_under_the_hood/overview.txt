Javascript


High-level
L> Any computer program needs resources
- There are low level programming
languages such as C where the 
developer has to manage resources
manually
- There are high level languages
where the developer does not have
to worry, everything happens
automatically.
L> These lanuages have abstractions
which handles that work for us
L> Easier to learn but not as 
fast or optimized as programs
written in C, for example.

Garbage-collection
L> An algorithm inside the 
Javascript engine which
automatically removes old, unused
objects from the computer memory.

Interpreted or just-in-time compiled
- Human readable Javascript code is 
an abstraction over machine code.
- This code is eventually translated/
converted to machine code (compiling)
- In the case of Javascript, this 
happens inside the Javascript 
engine.

Multi-paradigm
L> A paradigm is an approach and
mindset of structuring code, 
which will direct your coding
style and technique.
1. Procedural programming
2. Object-oriented programming (OOP)
3. Functional programming (FP)

Prototype-based object-oriented
L> Let take arrays. Arrays are
built from the Array Prototype.
Our aray inherits methods from
the prototype.
L> A prototype is like a blue-
print.

First-class Functions
L> In a language with first-class
functions, functions are simply
treated as variables. We can
pass them into other functions, and
return them from functions.

Dynamically-typed language
L> No data type definitions.
Types become known at runtime.
- Data type of variable is auto-
matically changed.

Single-Threaded
Non-blocking event loop
- Concurrency model: how the Java-
script engine handles multiple tasks
happening at the same time.
- Javascript runs in one single 
thread, so it can only do one thing
at a time.
- A thread is a set of instructions
executed in the computer's CPU
- What if we have a long-running 
task?
L> Sounds like it would block the 
single thread. However, we want
non-blocking behavior
- How do we achieve that?
L> By using an event loop: takes
long running tasks, executes them 
in the "background", and puts them 
back in the main thread once they
are finished.



The Javascript engine

What is a Javascript Engine?
L> a computer program that exec-
utes Javascript code.
L> Google's V8 powers Google
Chrome and node.js
L> Any Javascript engine contains
a Call Stack and a Heap.
- A Call Stack is where our 
code is executed using something
called execution contexts.
- A heap is an unstructured
memory pool that stores all the
objects that our application needs.

Compilation Vs. Interpretation

- Compilation: Entire code is
converted into machine code at
once, and written into a binary
file that can be executed by a
computer.
Source code
L> Step 1: Compilation
Portable file: machine code
L> Step 2: Program running
- Execution can happen way
after compilation

- Interpretation: Interpreter
runs through the source code
and executes it line by line.
Source code
L> Step 1: Execution line
by line
Program running
- Code still  needs to be con-
verted into machine code, but
it happens right before its 
executed and not ahead of time.
- Javascript used to be a purely
interpreted language
- Trade-off is that programs
take much longer to run
- Instead of simple interpretation,
modern Javascript engines now use
a mix between compilation and
interpretation.
This approach is called JIT comp-
ilation
- Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation:
L> Entire code is converted into
machine code at once, then exec-
uted immediately.
Source code
L> Step 1: Compilation
Machine Code (NOT a portable
file)
L> Step 2: Execution
(happens immediately)
Program running 


Modern Just-In-Time Compilation 
Of Javascript

Step 1: parse/read the code
L> Parsed into a data struct-
ure called the abstract syn-
tax tree or AST.

Step 2: Compilation (JIT)
L> Takes this AST and translates
it into machine code

Step 3: Execution
L> This machine code gets
executed right away.
L> Execution happens in the
Javascript engine's call stack.

Modern Javascript engines
create a very unoptimized 
version of machine code 
in the begining, just so it
can start executing as fast
as possible.
Then, in the background, 
this code is being opt-
imized and recompiled during
the already running program
execution.

Javascript Runtime 
L> The most common one is 
the browser
L> A big box/container which
includes all the things that
we need to use Javascript
- At the heart of any Javascript
runtime is the Javascript
engine.
- We also need access to the
web APIs
L> That's everything related
to the DOM, timers, console
.log, etc.. 
L> APIs are functionalities
provided to the engine
but which ar not part of
the Javascript language 
itself.
L> Javascript gets access
to these APIs through the 
global window object.
L> Web APIs are also part
of the runtime. 
- A Javascript runtime
also include a callback
queue.
L> A data structure that
contains all the callback
functions that are ready to 
be executed.
L> We attach event handler
functions to DOM elements,
like a button, to react to
certain events.
L> These event handler func-
tions are also called call-
back functions.
L> When a button is clicked,
for example, a call-back
function will be called.'
L> After the event, the 
call-back function is put
into the call-back queue.
L> When the call stack is
empty, the call-back func-
tion is passed to the stack,
so that it can be executed.
L> Happens by the event loop.
L> The event loops takes 
call-back functions from the
call-back queue and puts them
in the call stack, so that 
they can be executed.

Runtimes can exist outside 
the browser, as is the case
with Node.js



Execution Contexts and the Call Stack

- How is Javascript code executed?
- It happens in the call stack
in the engine.
- Suppose our code just finished compiling.
L> It's now ready to be executed.
L> A global execution context is created
for the top-level code.
L> Top-level code is code that is not 
inside any function.
L> In the begining, only code that is 
outside of functions will be executed.

- Execution Context: 
Environment in which a piece of Javascript
is executed. Stores all the necessary
information for some code to be executed.
L> Javascript code always runs inside
an execution context.

- Exactly one global execution 
context (EC):
L> Default context, created for code 
that is not inside any function 
(top-level)

- Execution of top-level code
(inside global EC)
L> Computer's CPU processing the
machine code that it received.

- Execution of function and waiting
for callbacks
L> When all functions are done exec-
uting, the engine will keep waiting 
for callback functions to arrive 
so that it can execute these.
L> It is the event loop that provides
these new callback functions.


Execution Context in Detail

- What's inside an execution context?

1. Variable Environment
L> let, const and var declarations
L> Functions
L> arguments object

2. Scope Chain

3. this keyword

- Generated during "creation phase",
right before execution

* Execution contexts belonging to
arrow functions do not get their 
own arguments keyword nor do 
they get the 'this' keyword
L> Instead, they can use the arg-
ument's object and the this key-
word from their closest regular
function parent.


The Call Stack
L> "Place" where execution contexts
get stacked on top of each other,
to keep track of where we are in the
execution
L> The execution context at the top
of the stack is the one that is 
currently running.
L> When it's finished running,
it will be removed from the stack
and execution will go back to the 
previous execution context
- The call stack ensures that the 
order of execution never gets lost.


Scope and the Scope Chain
- Each execution context has a var-
iable environment, scope chain and
a this keyword.
- Scoping: how our program's 
variables are organized and 
accessed. 
L> "Where do variables live?"
L> "Where can we access a 
certain variable, and where not?"

- Lexical Scoping: scoping is 
controlled by placement of func-
tions and blocks in the code;
L> a function written inside
another function has access
to the variables of the parent
function.

- Scope: Space or environment
in which a certain variable is 
declared (variable environment 
in case of functions). There is
a global scope, function scope,
and block scope.

Scope of a variable: region of
our code where a certain var-
iable can be accessed.


3 Types of Scope

Global Scope
L> For top-level code
L> Outside of any function or
block
L> Variables declared in glob-
al scope are accessible every-
where.

Function Scope
L> Variables are accessible
only inside function, NOT 
outside
L> Also called local scope

Block Scope (ES6)
L> Variables are accessible
only inside block (block scoped)
L> Block meaning everything 
within curly brackets
L> HOWEVER, this only applies
to let and const variables!
- Functions are also blocked
scoped (only in strict mode).

Every scope always has access 
to all the variables from all
its outer scopes.


The Scope Chain
- If one scope needs to use 
a certain variable but cannot
find it in the current scope,
it will look up in the scope
chain and see if it can find
a variable in one of the 
parent scopes.
- If it can, it will use that
variable
L> If it can't, there will be
an error.
L> This process is called 
Variable Lookup
- One scope can look up in the
scope chain, but it cannot look
down
L> Parent scopes can be used in 
Variable Lookup but not child
scopes.

- Scoping asks the question:
"Where do variables live?"
or "Where can we access a 
certain variable, and where
not?"
- There are 3 types of scope
in Javascript: the global
scope, scopes defined by
functions, and scope defined
by blocks.
- Only let and const variables
are block-scoped. Variables
declared with var end up in the
closest function scope.
- In Javascript, we have lex-
ical scoping, so the rules
of where we can access variables
are based on exactly where in 
the code functions and blocks 
are written.
- Every scope always has access
to all the variables from all
its outer scopes. This is the
scope chain!
- When a variable is not in the 
current scope, the engine looks
up in the scope chain until it 
finds the variable it's looking 
for. This is called scope lookup.
- The scope chain is a one-way 
street: a scope will never, ever
have access to the variables of
an inner scope.
- The scope chain in a certain
scope is equal to adding together
all the variable environments of
the all parent scopes.
- The scope chain has nothing to
do with the order in which func-
tions were called. It does not
affect the scope chain at all!
