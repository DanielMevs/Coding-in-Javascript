DOM != Javascript
DOM Methods and Properties for
DOM manipulation are not part
of Javascript



Web APIs, or
Application Programming
Interface, offer
DOM Methods and Properties
that can can interact with
Javascript.
APIs are libraries that
are also written in 
Javascript and are 
automatically available
for us to use.

There is a DOM specification
that browsers like Chrome
and Safari implement.

Other Web APIs provided
by browsers include 
Timers, Fetch and
many more.
