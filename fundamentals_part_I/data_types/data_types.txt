DATA TYPES

1. Number: floating point numbers
L> Used for decimals and integers

2. String: sequence of characters
L> Used for text

3. Boolean: Logical type that can
    be true or false
L> Used for taking decisions

4. Undefined: Value taken by a var-
    iable that is not yet defined
L> 'Empty value'

5. Null: Also means 'empty value'

6. Symbol: Value that is unique
    and cannot be changed

7. BigInt: larger integers than the
    Number type can hold

Javascript has dynamic typing: We
    do not have to manually define
    the data type of the value
    stored in a variable. 
L> Instead, data types are determined
    automatically
    
* Value has type, NOT variable
